# 🚨 Incident Escalation Guide

A well-defined escalation process ensures that incidents are handled quickly, transparently, and by the right people. This guide supports consistent incident flow across all support tiers.

## 🧭 Escalation Flow

1. **Tier 1 – Initial Response**
   - Validate the issue
   - Check known errors or open incidents
   - Attempt basic troubleshooting
   - Document all actions taken

2. **Tier 2 – Specialized Support**
   - Deeper investigation
   - Workaround proposal
   - Coordination with other teams if needed
   - Update incident log and inform Tier 1

3. **Tier 3 – Experts & Engineering**
   - Root cause investigation
   - Code-level or architecture-level changes
   - System patching or deployment if required

4. **External Escalation (Vendors, Partners)**
   - SLA-based escalation
   - Formal case creation with external support
   - Document all interactions and results

- ⏱ **60+ min** → Trigger leadership and stakeholders
