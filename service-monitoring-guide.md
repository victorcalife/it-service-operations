## 🧩 Key Areas to Monitor

### 🖥️ Infrastructure
- CPU, Memory, Disk usage (threshold-based)
- Network latency and bandwidth
- Server availability (ping, uptime)
- Database connections and health

### 🌐 Applications
- Web/API response times and error rates
- Application-specific logs (filtered by severity)

## 🚦 Alert Prioritization

| Severity | Response Time     | Example                           |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Critical | Immediate         | ERP outage, core DB down          |
| High     | < 15 minutes      | Website slow, payment failures    |
| Medium   | < 1 hour          | Backup failed, low disk space     |
| Low      | Next business day | Non-critical log alerts, warnings |

## 🔧 Tools to Consider

- Zabbix, Nagios, Datadog, Prometheus
- Grafana (dashboards), ELK Stack (logs)
